        <p>An error (from the Latin errāre, meaning 'to wander'[1]) is an inaccurate or incorrect action, thought, or judgement.[1] In statistics, "error" refers to the difference between the value which has been computed and the correct value.[2] An error
            could result in failure or in a deviation from the intended performance or behavior.[3] Human behavior One reference differentiates between "error" and "mistake" as follows: An 'error' is a deviation from accuracy or correctness. A 'mistake'
            is an error caused by a fault: the fault being misjudgment, carelessness, or forgetfulness. Now, say that I run a stop sign because I was in a hurry, and wasn't concentrating, and the police stop me, that is a mistake. If, however, I try to
            park in an area with conflicting signs, and I get a ticket because I was incorrect on my interpretation of what the signs meant, that would be an error. The first time it would be an error. The second time it would be a mistake since I should
            have known better.[4] In human behavior the norms or expectations for behavior or its consequences can be derived from the intention of the actor or from the expectations of other individuals or from a social grouping or from social norms.
            (See deviance.) Gaffes and faux pas can be labels for certain instances of this kind of error. More serious departures from social norms carry labels such as misbehavior and labels from the legal system, such as misdemeanor and crime. Departures
            from norms connected to religion can have other labels, such as sin.</p>
